- print(f) is a function call for formatted string literals, known as f-strings. 
  - Concise way to embed expressions and variables directly into strings
  - Inside the f-string, expressions enclosed in {} are evaluated and values are inserted into strings --> dynamic string creation
  ```
  name = "Maddie"
  print (f"My name is {name}.")
